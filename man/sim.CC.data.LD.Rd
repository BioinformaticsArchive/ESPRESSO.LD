\arguments{
  \item{n}{Number of observations to generate per
  iteration}

  \item{ncases}{Number of cases to simulate}

  \item{ncontrols}{Number of controls to simulate}

  \item{max.sample.size}{Maximum number of observations
  allowed}

  \item{pheno.prev}{Prevalence of the binary outcome}

  \item{freq1}{Minor allele frequency of the 1st genetic
  determinant}

  \item{g1.model}{Genetic model of the 1st genetic
  determinant; 0 for binary and 1 for additive}

  \item{g1.OR}{Odds ratios of the 1st genetic determinant}

  \item{freq2}{Minor allele frequency of the 2st genetic
  determinant}

  \item{g2.model}{Genetic model of the 2st genetic
  determinant; 0 for binary and 1 for additive}

  \item{g2.OR}{Odds ratios of the 2st genetic determinant}

  \item{r}{desired level of correlation if the two SNPs are
  modelled as being in LD.}

  \item{b.OR}{Baseline odds ratio for subject on 95 percent
  population centile versus 5 percentile. This parameter
  reflects the heterogeneity in disease risk arising from
  determinates that have not been measured or have not been
  included in the model.}

  \item{ph.error}{misclassification rates: 1-sensitivity
  and 1-specificity}
