\arguments{
  \item{n}{Number of subjects to simulate}

  \item{ph.mean}{statistical mean}

  \item{ph.sd}{standard deviation}

  \item{freq1}{Minor allele frequency if the 1st of the two
  genetic variant}

  \item{freq2}{Minor allele frequency if the 2nd of the two
  genetic variant}

  \item{g1.model}{Genetic model; 0 for binary and 1 for
  additive}

  \item{g1.efkt}{Effects of the 1st genetic variant}

  \item{g2.model}{Genetic model; 0 for binary and 1 for
  additive}

  \item{g2.efkt}{Effects of the 2nd genetic variant}

  \item{LD}{Sets independence or LD between the two SNPs: 0
  for independence and 1 for LD}

  \item{r}{desired level of correlation if the two SNPs are
  modelled as being in LD.}

  \item{pheno.rel}{reliability of the assessment for a
  quantitative outcome.}
