Description: The package allows for the Estimation of Sample-size and Power by
    Exploring Simulated Study Outcomes for two genetic variants (SNPs) in
    Linkage Disequilibrium. It supports simulation-based power calculation for
    stand-alone case-control studies and for case-control analyses nested in
    cohort studies, that take account of realistic assessment error.
